## About

Aim is to read texts from twitter and facebook files and use linguistic markers present in them to analyse mood.
The mood analysed over the last 10 posts (or over time, if it is a frequent user) is the current mood.
This shall also measure post interaction, i.e. if a user has been engaging with posts tagged as "sad" more recently the current mood will be hinting towrds sad.
The project aims at creating a ai system that analyses social media posts. A continually occuring 'sad' indicator will be hinting depression.
